>Meet Greg - a controversial livestreamer, political commentator and trans man. Everything's going wrong for Greg - his housemate won't talk to him, his audience is mad at him and he's getting roasted online after he tanked a debate with an up-and-coming TERF.

TruScum, written by Oscar Bray, is a play that grapples with internalized self-hatred, transphobia, mental illness, the patriarchy and toxic masculinity. Greg works through these parts of himself in an online space, and yet the consequences for himself and those around him couldn’t be more real.
